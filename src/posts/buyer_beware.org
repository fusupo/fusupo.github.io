#+TITLE: Buyer Beware [2017-08-04 Fri] 

** TL;DR

Back in the day, when I aspired to become an artist/animator I embraced and
devoted myself to a process of questioning and ultimately disintegrating
critical aspects of my relationship with the popular culture. It remains to be
seen wether or not this was a mistake but as a result I harbor some seemingly
unconventional ideas about where we are and where we're going as a society. It's
not uncommon that I might find myself labeled a contrarian by some individual or
another but those who know me understand I invest a significant amount of
calories in forming my own opinions. Part of the challenge in my endeavor to
take this step into a technical blog is to keep it technical. I'm an 'as above,
so below' kind of guy. My personal philosophy includes the concept that reality
is a contiguous space and that most of our alnguage and systems of thought are a
mechanism of arbitrarrilr categorization designed to help create an abstract
mental model through which we engage with the world. Critically for myself and
for western society (at leadt) I beleibe we'be yet to fully embrace the
responsibility or implications of our ability to cleave this spave into an
undertandable environment. Without furher belaboring of the poinr it is my
opinion that the motivation, creation, and distribution of software in this
current industrial landscape is worfully devoid of fundamental ethical or
philosophical consideration.

This is, like, a real proble,. Aproblem in that, to my reckoning, there are few
if any _real_ values driving the innovation other than the excitement we as
programmers and consumers experience with novelty, ovelapping with the provit
motive. A lot of marketing terms and buzzwords are meployed to justify the
creation and usefulness of some of our moire popular comsu,er technology
offerings but not one of those employments is immune to deep critisms as it
pertains to their impacts on individual lives, our collective provacy and safety
with regards to the proliferation of personal information coupled with
increasing advancements in the algorithmic processing thereof. We have
envisioned the A.I. driven apocolypse to such resolution that som of todays most
prolifiv thinskers are publicly concerned that we are on a path towards it's
manifestation, yet we seem at a lose to prevent this fom happenong. Made to read
the great distopic novels in High School but still as a group of [oft quite
young] proffessionals seem to be lacking the breadth of perspective to recognize
that we gave one foot squarely in the domain of a future of that type,
presently.

'Convenince' is a big thing in this regard. Indeed much of my critisism of
current sociological trends stems from my observation of a divorve bewtween
superficial emotional attachments we have with the terms we use and the manifest
implications of the applications of these soft notions in the harder space of
'concrete' reality. Systems desidned or touted as preconfigure integrations of
hardware and sofware meant to unlock the consumers creativity ultimatly put them
in a position of being held hostage within a coorporate ecosystem exposeinf them
to extortion and to the homogonizstion of thought. Plastforms designe to connect
us personally manifest to alienate and depress the individual. To spiral our
conception of living into an outer space of self promotion of consumption,
exess, self love, and indadequacy. A few years ago the obsessive buzzword in
Silicon Valley was 'disruption'. Where that term is a distincly amoral
descriptor of an affect we see a rise of technologies that hreaten the
livelyghood of individuals in that arena of lifestyle that is the ovelap of our
economic and phsycological lives (rise of the automotron).

I get it, myself half subscribed to the popular story we tell ourselves about
the ever forward progress of civilization it's unnavoidable that things will
change and transitions are innately accompanied by feelings of discomfort as our
perceptions readjust. Can't make an omlette...etc. But are we in fact master
chefs carefully selecting and measuring our ingredients, masterfully transmuting
them with tools and technique through an alchemical process to crteate the dish
we indended to. Or are we more like unsupervised children tossing groceries
against the wall and playing with a stove that could seriously burn us? Just cuz
you break the eggs doesn't mean the omlette is going to come together.
Especially if its difficult to create the mental image of the Omlette in the
first place. There is a large degree of the current human activity that happens
as a result of compulsion as opposed to deliberation.

We loose something when delegate responsibility. For instance as I have (or have
accepted to) offset the responsibility of food production to the farmer, at the
time of thei writting I have only a loose conception of how long in takes an
apple to form from flower to fruit. Indeed I've spent 3 decades without knowing
how th eapple forms form the flower(hint: the secrets in that star shaped
structure on it's south pole). Its a fact that men and women live full and
'complete' lives withour any significant relationshiop to the natural mechanisms
which aid the sustenance of that existence. With regards to mere survival, fine,
so long as I'm close to civilization but I'm sure I would have a hard time in
the wilderness if suddenly lost there tomorrow. There is a deeper issue though,
and it's one of context for if I don't have a relationship with the natural
process by which foodstuffs come into being than I lack some understand about
myself and my place in the ecosystem, the world, and the universe.

We are hard pursuing a path towards offsetting our material resoinsibilities on
machines as much as we can. This has been part of the vision for sometime, a
future where machines are handling all of our mundane bussiness leaving us to
lives of liesure, or to pursue humanities true calling. However, the society
that we are witnessing develop (and are ourselves developing) is not our of the
pages of a Popular Mechanics magaxine for the 1930s for that one was wallowed to
be a pure fantasy/unattached form its historical reality. What we have now is
something different that is moored to the rules of reality(whatever those are)
and can't be foumed oursid of the context of our modes of thought, our limited
creativity, and selective application of ethics. Ther is a nd perhaps always has
been a space between the producer and the concuper for dishonesty, moct
deceifully on the part of the producer. Today we ar messing with forces which at
ehe least have the power to fundamentally alter our perception of reality and at
worse to destroy us in the horrible way that only some premenisced nightmare
come to life can.

Like many propl (I imagine most) I stareted my relatinship with computing in a
state of total infatuation. For maybe decades what drove my further adventures
ddeper and deepre into the jungles of algorithmic data transformation was mostly
the novelty of it all. Insofar as I can love a thing inanimate and conceptual I
love computer programming. I put it in the same supercategory as the visual arts
or music, with all thos same cultural implecations. We tell oursleves that
technology solves problems without recohnizing its hydra like nature; for every
solution applied multiple other issues spring up. This is a rule. Nay, the
technology isn't for problem solving bur for perspective framing. On the long
timeline, we as a race of people will have to embrace and guard our natural
mandate to deliberately define our perspective on reality and the terms under
which we will and will refuse to address it under. As far as I can see our
culture doesn't really have the ability to say 'we can do this but we choose not
to'.

This is a '.github.io' namespace and so further exposition should be focused on
that which is appropriate to commit to version controll. Namely softeware, it's
production, conceptualization, etc. I felt it necessary to give some background
into my personal motivations in the arena of computer programming. To put it
bluntly, fundamentally I could give a shit about React v. Angular (seemingly a
closed debate at the moment), FP v. OOP, the absurd churning of the javascript
ecosystem etc. I'm interested in novel applications, I think we need richer
computing experiences but not necessarily 'intelligent' ones.

Hello. Every new blog needs an introductory post so here is mine.

What is my motivation?

While I would like to keep the content of this volume of personal media more or
less dry and technical, knowing myself I doubt this will be possible. Alas, I am
a man filled with opinions, both technical and otherwise, many of which are
unconventional.

Herein I want to explore some of these ideas.

I do alot of thinking aboput alot of stuff. That this is a '.github.io'
namespace I'm going to try to keep my exposition of thoughts and experimentation
within the domain of programming and computer science.  It won't be completely possible, however, as ...

Jesus Christ! I don't know what I'm doing anymore!!!!!

I'm stuck on alternate timeline. I view the Presidency of Donald Trump as
further corroboration that someone went back in time and changed something.

This is a '.github.io' namespace so I'll try to keep the discussion to that
which is appropriate to keep in version control.

There was a vision outlined by the likes of Busch and Kay and McArthy.
