<p>
Like any computer nerd worth his salt I have a healty preoccupation with
productivity tools. A couple of years ago I proposed to emacs and emacs said
'yes'. We were married in the fall of 2015. How we met, after my years of
disillusionment with my other prospects, how I fell in love and chose to commit
is a story for another day. Suffice it to say that my ongoing short-medium term
goal is to continue to place as much of my personal computing experience as I
can (and is practical) into emacs' very capable hands.
</p>

<p>
It's almost impossible to conceive of a personal productivity system without the
employment of a list of todos. Emacs' org-mode is an environment well suited for
this task.(A comprehensive description of which would be too long for this post,
<a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/index.html">try here</a>). In a nutshell, org-mode is a 'major mode' in emacs, a module of
functionality often used to handle the editing environment of a particular
filetype e.g. '.js','.clj','.org'. 'Org' is a file format, similar to Markdown,
focused on outlining hierarchical lists with some ASCII based rich text included
(tables!). Org-mode has some built in features for keeping track of todos and
related scheduling information (among other things). I also use org-habits for
habit tracking and org-agenda to get various time-based views and filters
applied onto my list of todos. Nothing too complicated; a system heavily
inspired by David Allen's GTD but on a platform with nigh infinite extensibility
if/when necessary in the future to either capture new (types) of todos or
associated infos and/or to process the accumulation of completed todos and logs
to gain further insight into the effectiveness of the system.
</p>

<p>
One problem though is that the experience is more or less locked down to my
laptop. Were it convenient I would run emacs on my phone but in the meantime
I've been faced with a disruption in my productivity work-flow particularly
around capturing todos/notes on the fly, logging habits in real-time, and
viewing my daily agenda on the go.
</p>

<p>
The only system that ever worked for me in that regards was when years ago I
would keep my GTD system in a <a href="http://www.checkettsweb.com/tw/gtd_tiddlywiki.htm">GTDTiddlyWiki</a> and periodically hard-print the
system into a stack of index cards I could keep in my back pocket. Worked great
until I lost that stack of index cards enough times so as to loose the
psychological benefits of the system.
</p>

<p>
I'm aware of <a href="http://mobileorg.github.io/">mobileOrg</a> and have tried to use it with my personal system. I don't
want to speak ill of the developers of that app or their product, in part it's
inspired this work, but it just didn't fit as I would've wanted it to. My
work-flow relies heavily on capture, habits, and agenda. Further I'm a visual
guy, I like to see the data represented as fancy graphics. After probably like a
decade of search for a workable computer based integrated desktop + mobile
productivity solution, including a couple of years trying different iOS text
editing apps to serve as the mobile component(<a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/">another</a> of which has inspired me
recently), I have committed to creating a solution to satisfy my needs:
</p>

<p>
<b>MobileOrg:Too</b>
</p>

<p>
Speaking of control; when I drive, I like to drive stick. When I compute I like
to run Linux. Heretofore I've been <i>a little</i> classed out of iOS development.
The equation of my personal interest in developing for that platform divided by
the barrier to entry until recently was greater than what I was willing to
engage with. React-&gt;React-Native-&gt;<a href="https://expo.io/">Expo</a> has really opened the door to exploring
the development of applications for mobile platforms without the need of a local
XCode enabled environment or an Apple Developer credential(at least for initial
phases). Using these tools, I've recently achieved a very initial version of the
app and having done so am committing to documenting some of the further progress
of the development of this application here.
</p>

<p>
I was about to put up screenshots but I'm too embarrassed. If you want to check
it out find the published project on expo <a href="https://expo.io/@fusupo/mobile-org-too">here</a> (source <a href="https://github.com/fusupo/mobile-org-too">here</a>). Upon opening
you'll be asked to log into drop box (we don't save passwords or tokens, yet).
Asked to give mobile-org-too access to your Dropbox account. You'll then be
asked for an inbox org-file relative to your Dropbox root. (I have an 'org'
directory at the root of my Dropbox folder where I keep my org files so I enter
'/org/inbox.org' where 'inbox.org' is an actual org file in that directory). If
everything goes well, the inbox inputText should be bordered in green and the
app will have loaded and parsed your inbox org entries. You can browse/edit/add
org-entries on the leftmost tab, view and log-completed habits and agenda items
on the second-from-left tab. Constructive feedback embraced.
</p>

<p>
A loose list of current application features:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Dropbox login
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>using WebView to hit Dropbox auth target url, not currently saving the auth
token between sessions but might still in the future.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Home Screen
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Lists the contents of the chosen 'inbox' org file (as described in settings below)</li>
<li>provides a button to add a new blank todo entry which is inserted as the
last top-level headline of the inbox file</li>
<li>provides ability to press an element headline to view/edit element details</li>
<li>provides ability to expand/collapse display of an entries children much like
the use of the &lt;TAB&gt; key in emacs org-mode proper.</li>
<li>details screen also activated/navigated to when new node is created</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Details screen
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>split into two sections:</li>
<li>details proper
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Todo keyword. The pressing of which deploys a popup to add/edit/remove
current headline keyword</li>
<li>the entry headline, edited through inputText</li>
<li>a section containing the various timestamps (scheduled, deadline, and a
personally defined 'opened' which may be removed in the future)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>allows definition of date with native date-picker</li>
<li>allows ability to define the timestamp repeat interval</li>
<li>also ability to clear the timestamp definition entirely</li>
</ul></li>
<li>a section containing the elements of the entries prop drawer if any
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>allows for CRUD operations on the key value pairs in the prop drawer, however:</li>
<li>disallows re-description of the key once that has been set</li>
</ul></li>
<li>a section containing the various logbook items
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>at the moment assumes each log entry will either be the logging of a
state transition, or a log-note as defined through the C-c C-z workflow</li>
<li>allows CRUD operations on the later type of entry, the state transition
log entries are read-only but otherwise delete-able</li>
</ul></li>
<li>editable textfield containing the body text</li>
</ul></li>
<li>lower scrollView which displays the focused entries children in a list/tree
re-using components from the Home Screen</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Calendar Screen
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>also split into two sections:</li>
<li>Agenda View
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>lists, in chronological order, todos (currently only with "scheduled"
properties) against a couple of delimiters for selected hours of the day,
including 'now' (essentially recreating org-agendas 2day agenda view in
app)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Habits
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>displays a 21 day habit graph</li>
<li>pressing on an item registers that Item as having been completed
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>inserts a state transition log entry in the associated todo</li>
<li>also advances the 'scheduled' and 'last repeat' timestamps for the
entry, respecting the repeat interval definition of the habit</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Settings Screen
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Choice of inbox.org file
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>validates that path can be found and that path is a file on inputText blur</li>
<li>using <a href="https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/securestore.html">Expo.SecureStore</a> to store user preferences</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Dropbox uploading</li>
<li>"parsing" of (subset) org text document into a custom POJO based representation</li>
<li>later serialization of our JS object structure back to plain text org file
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>at the moment of this writing, enforces some, perhaps, non-standard
indentation rules, this may change</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
